It will give print "Press pushbutton for predicting images"

Press pushbutton connected to GPIO-15

It will ask for prompt "Enter path of image directory where images are present:"

Give prompt input as ./test_orig

- Note: Don't press pushbutton until current prediction operation is finished, else it will ask for next prompt

Once all finish, press ctrl+c

Output log - ./log/out.txt
